## Usage

Install from source:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/boxdot/gurk-rs
```

Run

```
gurk
```

On the first run, this will open a QR code in your favorite image viewer, such that you can link the
device. This will also create a configuration file at the default [config
location][config-location]. For the configuration directives, see [`src/config.rs`].
