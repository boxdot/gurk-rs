# Installation

## Pre-compiled binary

Download a pre-compiled binary from [Releases] for following targets:

* `x86-64 Linux GNU`
* `x86-64 Linux musl`
* `aarch64 Linux GNU`
* `aarch64 Linux musl` (>= `v0.2.4` only)
* `x86-64 Darwin`
* `aarch64 Darwin`

## From source (using `cargo`)

Prerequisites:

* [`protoc`] compiler
* `perl`

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/boxdot/gurk-rs gurk
```

## Arch Linux

Packaged in the AUR: `gurk-git` and `gurk-bin`

## Nix/NixOS

Either per user:

```
$ nix-env --install gurk-rs
```

or system-wide:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ gurk-rs ];
```

# Usage

Run

```
gurk
```

On the first run, it will open a QR code in your favorite image viewer, such that you can link the
client as a new device. This will also create a configuration file at the default [config
location][config-location]. For the configuration directives, see [`src/config.rs`].

Note: The binary cannot be published on crates.io, because it depends on several official Signal
libraries that are not available on crates.io.

## Custom keybindings
The default keybindings can be overwritten at startup by configuring
keybindings in `gurk.toml` using the format `keybindings.<mode>.<keycombination> =
"<command>"`. Valid commands are `anywhere`, `normal`, `message_selected`,
`channel_modal`, `multiline`, and `help`. Valid key combination specifiers are e.g. `left,
alt-j, ctrl-f, backspace, pagedown`. The default keybindings can be disabled by
setting `default_keybindings = false`. An empty command removes an existing
binding if it exists in the given mode. Configuration troubleshooted by running
`RUST_LOG=gurk=trace,presage=trace,libsignal=trace gurk --verbose` and examining the resulting `gurk.log`.

### Supported commands

toggle_channel_modal
toggle_multiline
