[Signal Messenger] client for terminal.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Usage

Download a pre-compiled binary from [Releases], or install from source:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/boxdot/gurk-rs gurk
```

Run

```
gurk
```

On the first run, it will open a QR code in your favorite image viewer, such that you can link the
client as a new device. This will also create a configuration file at the default [config
location][config-location]. For the configuration directives, see [`src/config.rs`].

Note: The binary cannot be published on crates.io, because it depends on several official Signal
libraries that are not available on crates.io.
